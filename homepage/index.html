            In November 2018, Frisco ISD voters approved a $691 million bond
            package to provide funding to build four new schools and maintain
            and repair existing facilities. Funds will also provide additional
            resources for classroom technology and school security, as well as
            additional student opportunities in academics, fine arts and
            athletics. The bond program is intended to take the District through
            72,000 students or the end of the 2025-26 school year.
          </p>
          <p>
            The bond program was developed in spring and summer 2018 by the
            Facilities & Programs Evaluation Committee, an advisory group of
            FISD community members, parents, students and staff. Included
            projects were studied and recommended by the committee, which
            evaluated student enrollment projections, school building capacities
            and potential facility and maintenance projects. The committee’s
            work was the continuation of a two-year effort to engage the
            community in the District’s planning and decision-making process.
            The bond program received the support of 61 percent of voters.
